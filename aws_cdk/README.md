# Welcome to the CDK TypeScript project

Prior to running, you'll want to install the cdk globally:

```
npm install -g aws-cdk@2.73.0
```

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `yarn build`      compile typescript to js
* `yarn watch`      watch for changes and compile
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
